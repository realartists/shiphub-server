We received payment for your organization Ship subscription.

@string.Format("{0:C}", Model.AmountPaid) was charged to your card ending in "@Model.LastCardDigits" and covers service through @Model.ServiceThroughDate.ToString("MMM d, yyyy"). Attached is an invoice receipt for your records.

@if (Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersCount <= 5) {
<text>The base monthly fee of your subscription covers the first 5 active Ship users per month.  Your organization had @Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersCount active Ship users in the prior month beginning on @Model.PreviousMonthStart.ToString("MMM d, yyyy"), so there were no additional usage charges.</text>
} else {
<text>The base monthly fee of your subscription covers the first 5 active Ship users per month.  Your organization had @Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersCount active Ship users in the prior month beginning on @Model.PreviousMonthStart.ToString("MMM d, yyyy"), so you were billed for @(Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersCount - 5) additional active users.</text>
}

@if (Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersCount == Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersSample.Count()) {
<text>Active Ship users in your organization in the prior month were @(string.Join(", ", Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersSample))).</text>
} else {
<text>Active Ship users in your organization in the prior month included: @(string.Join(", ", Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersSample))), and @(Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersCount - Model.PreviousMonthActiveUsersSample.Count()) others.</text>
}

We appreciate your business!
