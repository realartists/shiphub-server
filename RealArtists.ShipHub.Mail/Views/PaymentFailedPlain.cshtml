We tried to process a charge for @string.Format("{0:C}", Model.Amount) to your card ending in @Model.LastCardDigits, but the transaction failed.

Reason: @Model.ErrorText

@if (Model.NextRetryDate != null) {
<text>We'll automatically retry this charge on @(Model.NextRetryDate.Value.ToString("MMM d, yyyy")).  If you need to update your payment information, follow the link below.

Attached is an invoice for your review.</text>
} else {
<text>We've failed to process this charge a few times now, so we'll go ahead and cancel your subscription.

If you want to re-activate your subscription later, you can do so from the Ship application.  From the "Ship" menu, choose "Manage Subscription".  Then click "Manage" for your account.</text>
