  -- This stored proc ensures that the first member of an organization
  -- is added, and that the last member is removed, despite having no
  -- organization members with valid tokens at either time.

  -- Adding the initial member *SHOULD NOT* trigger a sync, since
  -- SetOrganizationUsers will take care of it.
  
  -- Any removed member *MUST* trigger a sync, since there may
  -- no longer be any valid tokens for the OrganizationActor to use.
